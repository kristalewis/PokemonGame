<h4>Welcome</h4>
	
<p id="welcomeParagraph">
	Many of my childhood memories involve one thing - Pokémon.  Whether it was spending my allowance on
	cards, playing either Red, Yellow or Blue on my Gameboy color, watching the show or playing Stadium or
	Snap on the N64, it all brought a smile to my face.  I loved it.  With my new found programming skills I 
	thought it would be fun to create a project about something I enjoy and this was the obvious choice.  I 
	had a blast making this, and while it's not quite elite four material, it helped me on my programming 
	journey to becoming the very best (like no one ever was).  I hope you have as much fun with it as I did.
